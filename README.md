## Interpreting user needs
By interviewing the users and taking notes on the key concepts/ideas that they discuss, you are bringing one of the most important points of view to the table. The customers. When the customers discuss what they would like out of a program or features that they think would be nice, they are telling you how to sell them your software, they are providing instructions for how to make more money off of them!

Sometimes what the customers actually say may not translate well to the team so from the key points that you extrapolate from them, you can derive user stories to better highlight the requirement to the team and justify the need for the feature so that the team does not overlook it. If the team can relate to the feature and the justification for it, they are more likely to become susceptible to the implementation of it which will ultimately provides a better program.

## The future of my programming
I approach developing programs in two main mindsets depending on the task that I am attempting to tackle. On one hand, I will develop a program in a planned and structured way for simple tasks and small programs that have clearly defined requirements and acceptance criteria ahead of time. On the other hand, I will employ a much more agile approach to larger programs that will change on the fly as I develop and gain more insight into how the program is currently operating when I assess it during evaluation at the end of the implementation of a new feature or sprint.

Through these two processes I can maintain enough agile to be flexible while also having a rough structure for designing a program, enough so that the program does not fall out of scope and ensure that the required features are incorporated into the final product. I have not programmed on a team before but look forward to the prospect in the future. If I were to program on a team, I would like to use the Scrum framework to assist with team roles and help us work together on developing the final product. I especially love the idea of the daily scrum and definately will be including that on future works with multiple team members.

## Good team members
When developing software as a team, a good team member will communicate what they are working on, discuss any hinderances so that the team may assist or evaluate importance for any potential dependencies and will produce clean, documented code. To my last point, this is one of the most important parts of programming on a team, if your code is not clean and well documented it will be harder for other programmers to evaluate, adjust and debug in the future which will only add time to a project, offsetting the benefits of multi-programmer teams.
